I have a monthly subscription for my dog's stupid expensive prescription food, through Chewy. Had a notification it was delivered on the 26th - but it's nowhere to be found. Emailed Chewy and let them know on Sunday the 29th.
Less than 10 minutes after sending that message, I got an email saying a new shipment was on its way. Immediately followed by an email from a customer service rep apologizing and letting me know they sent a replacement free of charge. Fucking rad, that's some of the quickest and best customer service I've ever gotten online. 

BUT THEN. The package showed up (on a neighbor's porch. They don't like me very much so they hid it for a couple days I guess). 

I emailed Chewy back and told them it was here, apologized, and asked them to cancel the new order if it's not too late. They replied (again, insanely quickly), saying it was probably too late to cancel, but ""we would greatly appreciate it if you took the time to donate the food to a local animal shelter or rescue.""

Everything else is part of THEIR collective misinformation campaign to convince you to liquidate your shares in the belief it actually squoze, before they are forced to unload as we push their limits of solvency.

The short side is showing signs of unraveling.   I expect the brokers, dtcc, and government to be called in, when they realize shareholders ain't letting go of their shares at any price and a liquidation is imminent and they ultimately buyl at market ask on an endless software ""buying"" program to unload the short positions.

The world is under the leadership of the ape nation, a group of gorillionairs. I'm part of that group but I'm only a small fish. I could only effort a fraction of 0.1 of a share so I only made about 10 million dollars.

We are experiencing peaceful times. GameStop managed to end world hunger by donating 5% of it's yearly revenue. Ryan Cohen invested in research and managed to cure 90% of all diseases. Retards are still around tho.

Most of our wifes broke up with their boyfriends. We shorted nearly all Hedge Funds into bankruptcy. Stock market prices are now determined by demand of bananas.

Our King is very kindhearted and loved by the people. He is our ruler but prefers to stay in the background. He occasionally posts a YOLO update which is celebrated around the world.

When you buy stock, you should always have an exit plan envisioned. Something that lets you cut a profit, isn't stupid, but also isn't ""lets cut my losses."" Remember, were it any other stock, cashing out at a 30% gain is pretty swell for an average stock. But if you're extremely bullish about a stock's ability to grow, maybe that plan looks something like, ""I sell enough shares to cover my initial investment but not if it involves selling more than 1/5th of my total shares.""

1850,gsp9iuf,t3_mfo2qo,"Hahah this will in no way create material change for gme when its announced so yeah this is just more of a circle jerk looking for confirmation bias.

A real catalyst is substantial material change, ie they become profitable again, large insider purchasing reducing the float substantially, sp500 inclusion, stock buy backs, reverse split etc. this is just a fucking PR event any volume will be short lived and not meaningful in terms of creating the cascading effect needed for gme to squoze.

Reeealllllyyyy tired of these bullshit GME posts these days they just dont offer anything substantive these days. Like post when their is DD on how a REAL catalyst may happen. 

If you want to do your homework and understand why the VW squeeze was possible it was due to a massive amount of the float being taken off the market overnight. If 75% of gme float became unavailable for trading obviously it would fucking moon. You need to elaborate on how GME gets to that kind of point when you talk about a ‚Äúpotential catalyst‚Äù

Presuming a catalyst will have any effect on the actual price of a stock is meaningless in the current Clown Market, and it's infinitely more meaningless for a heavily manipulated stock like GME. No one is buying GME right now for its fundamentals and potential. They're buying it because it's poised for the MOASS. 

It's a good stock but that's not where we are currently at. After we bury the hedgies and they stop fucking with the stock THEN fundamentals will matter for GME. Until the squeeze has been squoze everything but Buy And Hold is pointless masturbation. 

Posts like these promising catalysts, or proclaiming lift off is right around the corner, or preemptively celebrating victory do nothing but get more naive and short term holders hyped up for something that could very well be months or years away. They hurt the cause more than help. Don't get me wrong, it's good news, but calling it a catalyst is dumb as hell. It'll have no affect on the stock.

The Primary Dealer Credit Facility was established in order to encourage financial markets to function more effectively. Primary dealers borrow overnight loans from the PDCF through their clearing banks at the primary credit rate offered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

A frequency-based fee is assigned to primary dealers who borrow from the PDCF on more than 45 business days.

Financial Crisis
The facility was one of a number of steps taken by the government to free up credit during the financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis was the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression of 1929. The crisis was the result of a sequence of events, each with its own trigger and culminating in the near collapse of the banking system. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which forced banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income minorities creating a market for subprime mortgages.

The Federal Reserve made loans totaling $8.95 trillion to primary dealers in exchange for a wide range of collateral under its Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley each received loans that total more than $1 trillion. However, these were overnight loans, which were frequently rolled over into new loans. Some 21,000 transactions with financial companies and foreign central banks were made using the facility.",t3_mfo2qo

If I were BestBuy, I might entertain the notion of allowing GME to assume management of my vidyer game business a'la kiosk (they would be responsible for inventory, etc) in exchange for a cut of the profit for allowing them to use my logistics and sales infrastructure. That would cut down on GME's overhead, boost best buy's revenue, get BB in to a market they have no presence in without excessive exposure (used games and game equipment), and allow GME to benefit from the weight and brand cachet of Best Buy.",t3_mfo2qo

Target and Best Buy have good deals/sales, but don't offer any kind of trade in deal so they shouldn't be too hard to outcompete.

All the shit you just described is the old business that GS (as well as Best Buy, Target, Walmart, et al) is transforming away from. Remember, RC is promising a transformation, not a double down on the old business model that was leading the company toward bankruptcy.
Apply Occam's Razor by favoring the solution that has the fewest assumptions, and we find that this meeting's agenda is how to address GS's competition in the new market.",t3_mfo2qo

2119,gsp4ail,t1_gsoz4pq,"I‚Äôve been in Best Buy to get a video game somewhat recently (Hitman III deluxe edition, GameStop sold out). It was a HORRIBLE experience. HORRIBLE. No one around to ask questions. Video game section was highly unorganized. I eventually found the game no where near the video game section while I was roaming around trying to find someone to ask. My opinion is that an Apple-esque store inside BB would likely be a stellar move by GS. There were numerous other people looking around having no clue as well.",t3_mfo2qo

BBY is 1) going down the tubes, and 2) entered into that deal with Apple (and MS, and Amazon, and Google, and to a lesser degree Samsung, Sony, and LG in the Home Theater Dept) so that they could a) actually sell those companies' products, and b) get the white glove support treatment (each of those companies have reps that visit stores regularly to train the sales team).

Gamestop doesn't make products that BBY would sell. Gamestop already has a ton of locations around the country. So neither of them need each other in the way BBY and those product suppliers do.",t3_mfo2qo
2121,gsp55eq,t1_gsoz4pq,"These are my thoughts exactly. Having a game stop mini store in Walmart, best buy, target, would be huge benefit for both side.

Also partner with amazon to have prime shipping almost overnight anywhere in the country.",t3_mfo2qo

Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. The point is, these Brick & Mortars (excepting Amazon) have already / are already making the transformation that GameStop is making.

Right now someone agreed to sell it at $250 a share.
That's way over what it's worth right now right .
So to compensate they had to pay $75 to sell it at $250. 
So effectively that person only makes money when the price goes 250 (the strike)-75 (the premium)= below $175 (the break even)

So that was the person who bought the put. 

The other side of the transaction assuming they own no shares (naked)
They agree to buy the shares at $250 anytime between now and expiry. 
For agreeing to this, someone paid them $75. 

So let's say it goes to $300. 
Someone isn't going to let them buy at $250 when it's worth $300. So the option isn't exercised. The buyer loses that $75 premium they paid, the writer gets to keep it. No shares trade hands. 

If it goes to $100. 
The writer received the $75 we talked about originally but now receives gamestop at $250. Their effective breakeven is $175. 

The buyer of the put paid that $75 and got to sell their shares at $250. Despite the fact the stock is $100.

2519,gsoz31m,t1_gsoy9za,Yeah Robinhood is admittedly nice looking and easy to buy at market price. But it is a bit uneasy to buy or sell in limits since they don't provide a number of how many bidders and askers there are. So you'd probably be paying a little bit extra per stock at market price. Never tried Vanguard but I may look into it. I'm also very into Penny Stocks that are on TD Ameritrade and Fidelity.

2520,gsq06cm,t1_gsoy9za,"I moved from RH to Vanguard.  Honestly I wouldn't recommend them based on my experience.  First, they won't reimburse the $75 ACAT transfer fee, if this was my only issue then I wouldn't hold that against them. Two, it took a full week to do the transfer, and when it was completed, all my stocks appeared in my account as margin. This was a pain in the ass to get fixed (and was probably Robinhood's fault), the first time I called Vanguard, they told me the transfer should have never gone through the first time and that they were suggesting we reverse the transfer and do it again (I hung up once that was suggested as I didn't want to go another 7 days with my assets frozen).  

I called back later in the day, talked to a different rep, explained my issue and he was able to resolve it (took 24 hrs, finally resolved, no asset transferring needed to be done).

Throughout this process, I wired some money to my account so I could have some capital to trade with (as my previous assets were on hold during the transfer process).  Even though the money cleared my account, it was still put on hold for 7 full days before I could begin using it due to having a new account.

I'm not sure if Fidelity or other brokerages work like this, but it was a lot of work to do something simple.  If you're transferring from RH, please be careful if you're transferring any options.",t3_mfp1kh
2521,gsow5dz,t1_gsouyll,"When you move assets as ""in-kind"" (which is a typical transfer), you get to keep the shares you bought at your cost basis. Bear in mind that your RH account will be locked for the duration (standard procedure), so you can only buy/sell in your new brokerage account. RH charges a $75 transfer fee, but Fidelity and Vanguard typically (I think) cover it on their end; either way make sure you have $75 ready in your bank account just in case.

The additional issue is that Robinhood is on a backlog of sending brokers your cost-basis (apparently too many people transferred out, so they are behind their work), so your cost basis will be wrong for a while. They are legally obliged to send your broker the correct cost basis in time (up to a month iirc), though.

I believe (someone correct me if I am wrong) however, that the information reported on your tax form 1099 should be correct in the end, but the information on your new brokerage account will be incorrect for a while until RH gets off their asses. It's a small downside for peace of mind though, I think.

You can manually request an update to your cost basis, but afaik you'll have to provide Fidelity and Vanguard with the exact cost of all the shares (each share has a unique ID).",t3_mfp1kh

And:

&#x200B;

1. You help them out because they can continue to short and take your premiums.
2. If you don't own the stock then you are not screwing them.

It's not that options are bad but are risky. I lost money each time I did it. They would go up and I'd be in significantly but I got greedy and then they went down and never got ITM. Well, I made some money on them a few times but it doesn't seem like it is worth it. They fuck around with them too much. I think when a lot of people buy options and could win major gains the MM and HF's manipulate the stock to keep those options OTM.

&#x200B;

If you don't know much about how they work it is a huge gamble and you are better off just buying the stock and riding it out.

I'd buy an options and then the volatility would drop to nothing and I'd lose. Even when the price went up and there was a lot of volatility the premium never would return. How people are betting on them defies logic. I think people are just trying to gamble them on both sides and it's very chaotic. If you just buy and hold you will probably end up with more money in the long run unless you get really lucky and it's just a lot easier to hold than try to time the options. You can't predict when it is going to spike and so you might hold to maximize profits then they short attack the stock and it's game over. By the time the stock gets back to the same price you've lost all your gains from theta(time decay).

&#x200B;

Now, if you want to buy an option you can, but you should at least have some idea how they work and to realize you are risking 100% of the premium...

If they tank the stock then you could buy some cheap long OTM calls in hopes that it will moon and you'll make a fortune... but it's risky.",t3_mfdqil
